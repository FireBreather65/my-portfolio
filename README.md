## Inspiration
This portfolio was on my todo list for months, but during 10 Days of Code (a [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)-run coding camp) I was able to start and finish my project!

## Features
This is a fully responsive website! There aren't many other features, just feel free to click around to learn more about me üôÇ

## Technologies
This website was built with Tailwind and React. This was my first time working with both, and they were really fun to learn and use.

## Challenges and accomplishments
I faced a lot of issues with React, most notably when learning to route my pages. However, I worked with a mentor to solve them :)

## What I learned
I learned a lot about React and Tailwind during this project! I really enjoyed working with Tailwind as it's a much better way to use CSS.

## Future plans
I have a lot of ideas for future implementations, such as adding a small decorative background like [this website](https://daysofservice.hackclub.com/code), incorporating a section for my photography, and adding light/dark mode.
