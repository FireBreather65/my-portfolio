        Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted a job in a creative field. Through the years I tried dabbling in writing, beading, origami, even piano - but when I obtained my GED at 16 and discovered the field of UX design, I knew I had found my calling. I fell in love with designing interfaces and the ability to use my natural creativity to positively impact users and the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        My past jobs have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and attention to detail - all crucial skills in my journey into UX. Iâ€™m also committed to equity-focused design, as I've found that hearing from diverse perspectives can positively impact the experience for all users.
