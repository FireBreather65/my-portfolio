        Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted a job in a creative field. Over the years, I dabbled in writing, beading, origami, even piano - but when I graduated high school at 16 and discovered UX design, I knew I had found my calling. I fell in love with designing interfaces and using my natural creativity to positively impact users and the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        My past jobs have taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and attention to detail - all crucial skills in my UX journey. Iâ€™m also deeply committed to equity-focused design, as I've found that hearing from diverse perspectives can positively impact the experience for all users.
